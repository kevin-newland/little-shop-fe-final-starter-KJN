### Context:
For this project as a total(Front End , and Back End) I had 6 days to complete. As most of the project time was spent getting the Back End functional my time on the Front End was limited. As a whole I am proud that I got the Front End functional and working properly.

Display data for users in a frontend application by targeting DOM elements
